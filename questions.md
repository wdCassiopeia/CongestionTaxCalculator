#Questions

- My first question I couldn't figure out was - why interfaces for vehicle, when a property in class (or at best, abstract class) could be used? Maybe it was one of the things to change (I left it for possible future value, but did not see the benefit). 
- Second- not so much of a question, but more a comment - I don/t think 4 hours is enough if including bonus requirement. If I understood correctly, the following should be non-hard-coded for use in different cities: 
    1) amounts to pay by hour
    2) days without toll
    3) vehicles without toll
    4) max amount per day
and whereas the points 2, 3 and 4 should be easy to store and implement, the first one would be a little trickier. It would be doable though - with a little more time than 4 hours max.
- Another comment: I did not implement a class for each vehicle type (it would be the same as the other ones) because I still think it should be solved just by vehicleType property.
